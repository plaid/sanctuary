//. ### Maybe type

//. The Maybe type represents optional values: a value of type `Maybe a` is
//. either a Just whose value is of type `a` or Nothing (with no value).
//.
//. The Maybe type satisfies the [Monoid][], [Monad][], [Traversable][],
//. and [Extend][] specifications.

//# MaybeType :: Type -> Type
//.
//. A [`UnaryType`][UnaryType] for use with [sanctuary-def][].
